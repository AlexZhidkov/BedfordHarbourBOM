# Bill Of Materials
A bill of materials is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. A BOM can define products as they are designed, as they are ordered, as they are built, or as they are maintained. 

# Core Use Cases
BOM Appliction allows user to know:
- how much of aw material and parts are in stock
- what is the monetary value of stock
- how many products can be produced from the curent stock
- which materials (in which quantities and at what cost) need to be ordered to produce desired quantity of end products
- how much it cost to build a product
